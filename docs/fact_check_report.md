### Actual Review Quote (Verified)
"John Miller's new book on sadomasochism brims with deep wisdom. Based on a lifetime of rich clinical experience, Miller has written an outstanding volume that not only explains the deep-seated, infantile origins of sadomasochistic perversity, but also illustrates how one makes deep therapeutic contact with sadomasochistic men and women in the consulting room. Drawing upon both classical psychoanalytical conceptualisations, and upon the work of later writers, in particular Donald Meltzer, the author has provided us with a tightly argued, passionate, and clear account of the dangers of sadomasochistic symptomatology and characterology, both in private life and in the culture at large." - Professor Brett Kahr

## BOOK 2: DO YOU READ ME? (2015)

### Actual Book Details
- **Full Title:** "Do You Read Me?: Learning Difficulties, Dyslexia and the Denial of Meaning"
- **NOT:** "Do You Read Me? Training for Analysts" - This title is COMPLETELY WRONG
- **Publisher:** Karnac Books (Routledge)
- **Publication Year:** 2015
- **ISBN:** 9781782200901 (paperback), 9780429912863 (eBook)
- **Price:** £36.99 (paperback)

### Actual Book Description
A fascinating and compelling exploration of the learning process for parents, teachers, and anyone with an interest in education.

**Main Argument:** Reading and writing are fundamentally about the communication of meaning. Yet, when a child has difficulty in learning to read and write, the one area that is never seen as having any relevance is the child's life experiences. Miller's contention is that **the concept of dyslexia is something that has been invented, rather than discovered, in order to evade the question of meaning and the understanding of the individual.**

The book examines this as part of a culture in which child-rearing and education are increasingly depersonalising, and children are viewed as assets or commodities rather than individuals.

**Core Thesis:** Based on 30 years' experience of both educational psychology and analytical therapy, the book sets out a radical approach to learning difficulties in which the primary assumption is that there will usually be **underlying emotional conflicts, tensions, and anxieties**. Any learning disability is thus more likely to be the symptom of less-evident, personal difficulties, rather than a problem in itself.

### Actual Chapter Structure (Verified)

**Subtitle:** "Three decades of clinical insight into sadomasochism, learning difficulties, and the emotional life of children"

### About J.F. Miller - Accurate Biography
Mr. J.F. Miller, M.A., is a psychoanalyst and psychotherapist based in Oxford, specialising in adult analysis, couple and family work, and educational psychology. With over 30 years of clinical experience, Miller has developed a distinctive post-Kleinian approach to understanding emotional development and psychological difficulties.

Miller read Psychology and Philosophy at St Catherine's College, Oxford, and completed postgraduate training in Educational Psychology at the Tavistock Clinic. He worked as County Psychologist to West Oxfordshire before entering private practice and completing analytical training.

Originally trained in Jungian analysis under colleagues of C.G. Jung, Miller subsequently developed his theoretical framework under the tutelage of Dr Donald Meltzer, adopting a post-Kleinian orientation. He has been a member of the International Association for Analytical Psychology for over 30 years and serves as a training analyst to various psychotherapy trainings.

His clinical work has taken him beyond the UK, including consultancy positions in Norway, Belgium, and France, working with residential institutions for troubled children and young people.

### Book 1 Page - The Triumphant Victim

**Main Description:**
*The Triumphant Victim* offers a provocative examination of sadomasochism and perverse thinking in both personal relationships and wider society. Miller argues that we live in a "culture of the victim" where suffering has become a source of identity and power.

Drawing on 30 years of psychoanalytical practice, Miller explores how sadomasochistic patterns obstruct emotional development and create dysfunctional relationships. The book examines these dynamics through the lens of hysteria, exhibitionism, voyeurism, and projective identification, illustrated with detailed clinical material.

In the second half, Miller turns his attention to society at large, examining how perverse thinking has infiltrated our belief systems, educational institutions, and cultural assumptions. He critiques the legacy of Cartesian dualism, explores the tension between masculine control and feminine values, and challenges both religious and secular fundamentalisms.

**Key Themes:**
- The psychopathology of sadomasochism in individuals and society
- How victimhood can become a rigid identity that prevents healing
- The role of projective identification in relationships
- Perverse thinking in education, religion, and cultural politics
- The influence of Donald Meltzer's post-Kleinian framework
- Pathways from victim consciousness to authentic emotional development

**Who This Book Is For:**
- Psychoanalysts and psychotherapists working with personality disorders
- Couple and family therapists addressing relational dynamics
- Educational psychologists and consultants
- Anyone interested in understanding the darker aspects of human psychology
- Readers concerned with cultural and political analysis through a psychoanalytic lens

### Book 2 Page - Do You Read Me?

**Main Description:**
*Do You Read Me?* presents a radical challenge to conventional thinking about dyslexia and learning difficulties. Miller argues that the concept of dyslexia has been "invented rather than discovered" - a medical label that conveniently avoids asking deeper questions about a child's emotional life and experiences.

Based on three decades as an educational psychologist and analytical therapist, Miller demonstrates that reading and writing difficulties are fundamentally about **the communication of meaning**. When children struggle to read, we rarely consider their life experiences, family dynamics, or emotional conflicts as relevant factors. Instead, we medicalise the problem as "dyslexia" - an organic brain condition that absolves us of having to understand the individual child.

This book examines learning difficulties within the context of a depersonalising culture where children are treated as assets or commodities. Miller provides a framework for understanding how underlying emotional conflicts, tensions, and anxieties manifest as learning problems.

**Key Themes:**
- Why "dyslexia" functions as a way to evade meaning and understanding
- The relationship between feeding, reading, and emotional nourishment
- Family dynamics and their impact on learning
- The role of aggression in healthy development
- Attention, interest, and boredom in the classroom
- Emotional blocks to reading and writing
- The difference between schooling and genuine education
- Related concepts: dysnumeracy, hyperlexia, and giftedness

**Who This Book Is For:**
- Parents whose children struggle with reading and writing
- Teachers and special education professionals
- Educational psychologists and school consultants
- Anyone questioning mainstream approaches to learning difficulties
- Professionals interested in the emotional dimensions of education

### Key Concepts Section (Based on Actual Work)

**The Triumphant Victim:**
A psychological configuration where suffering becomes a source of identity, moral superiority, and control. Miller identifies this pattern in individuals who unconsciously use their pain to dominate relationships and resist genuine change. The book explores how this dynamic operates not just in individuals but throughout society, creating a "culture of the victim."

**Perverse Thinking:**
A mode of thought that subverts meaning and genuine emotional connection. Drawing on post-Kleinian theory, Miller examines how perverse defences against reality manifest in individuals and organisations, from the consulting room to educational systems to political discourse.

**The Denial of Meaning:**
Miller's critique of how modern education treats children's learning difficulties as purely technical problems, ignoring the emotional and relational dimensions of reading and writing. He argues that dyslexia functions as a concept that allows us to avoid asking difficult questions about children's inner lives.

**Post-Kleinian Psychoanalysis:**
Miller's theoretical framework builds on the work of Melanie Klein and particularly Donald Meltzer. This approach emphasises the role of projective identification, the claustrum, and the importance of symbolic thinking in emotional development.
