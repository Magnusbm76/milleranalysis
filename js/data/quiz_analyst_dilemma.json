        "title": "Integrated Analytic Position",
        "summary": "Your responses indicate a sophisticated understanding of inherent dilemmas in analytic practice. You demonstrate a remarkable capacity to tolerate fundamental tensions and paradoxes that define therapeutic work. This suggests you've developed a nuanced relationship with the unstable nature of meaning and language limitations that frame clinical practice. Your ability to navigate these challenges without seeking premature resolution indicates advanced analytic maturity.",
        "recommendation": "Continue cultivating this balanced approach to analytic dilemmas. Your comfort with ambiguity and uncertainty serves as a foundation for effective clinical work. For further exploration of these concepts, see the chapter on 'Analytic Positioning' in 'Do You Read Me' and the section on 'The Space Between Interpretation' in 'Triumphant Victim'."

        "title": "Developing Analytic Tolerance",
        "summary": "Your responses reveal a developing awareness of the fundamental dilemmas in analytic work. You may occasionally feel conflicted about the tensions between structure and discovery, interpretation and silence, or patient expectations and analytic goals. This suggests you're navigating the complex paradoxes of clinical practice with growing success, though there may be moments when these dilemmas create genuine uncertainty or discomfort.",
        "recommendation": "Consider developing greater comfort with the inherent ambiguities of analytic practice. Practicing tolerance for the impossible positions that define therapeutic work can enhance your clinical effectiveness. For deeper understanding of these dynamics, refer to the chapter on 'Clinical Tensions' in 'Do You Read Me' and the section on 'Therapeutic Paradoxes' in 'Triumphant Victim'."

        "title": "Significant Analytic Conflict",
        "summary": "Your responses indicate a strong experience of fundamental dilemmas as a source of professional conflict and uncertainty. You may frequently feel torn between competing demands of analytic work or struggle with the paradoxical nature of therapeutic interventions. This pattern suggests that inherent tensions of clinical practice significantly impact your confidence and effectiveness as an analyst.",
        "recommendation": "Your relationship with these fundamental dilemmas warrants careful exploration. Consider developing strategies for working within analytic tensions rather than seeking to resolve them. The chapter on 'Impossible Positions' in 'Do You Read Me' and the section on 'Working Through Dilemmas' in 'Triumphant Victim' provide essential frameworks for understanding these dynamics."
