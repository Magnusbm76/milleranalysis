        "title": "Integrated Understanding of Victimhood",
        "summary": "Your responses demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of victimhood as a structural dimension of psychic organization. You show remarkable capacity to recognize the complex dynamics and functions of victimhood beyond simple suffering or powerlessness. This suggests you've developed a nuanced understanding of how victimhood operates as a fundamental structure in emotional life. Your ability to work with the architectural dimensions of victimhood indicates advanced analytic maturity.",
        "recommendation": "Continue cultivating this integrated approach to victimhood structures. Your understanding of the complex nature of victimhood serves as a foundation for effective clinical work. For further exploration of these concepts, see the chapter on 'Victimhood Structure' in 'Do You Read Me' and the section on 'The Architecture of Victimhood' in 'Triumphant Victim'."

        "title": "Developing Understanding of Victimhood",
        "summary": "Your responses reveal a developing awareness of victimhood as a structural dimension of psychic organization. You may occasionally recognize the complex functions of victimhood or its architectural organization, though this understanding may not be fully integrated into your approach. This suggests you're beginning to navigate the complex dynamics of victimhood with growing success.",
        "recommendation": "Consider developing greater awareness of how victimhood operates as a structure in psychic organization. Practicing attention to the architectural dimensions of victimhood can enhance your clinical effectiveness. For deeper understanding of these dynamics, refer to the chapter on 'Victimhood Dynamics' in 'Do You Read Me' and the section on 'Structural Dimensions' in 'Triumphant Victim'."

        "title": "Limited Understanding of Victimhood",
        "summary": "Your responses indicate a primary focus on victimhood as a state of suffering with limited recognition of its structural organization. You may struggle to see the complex functions or architectural dimensions of victimhood in psychic life. This pattern suggests that the structural nature of victimhood may be underexplored in your understanding of therapeutic work.",
        "recommendation": "Your understanding of the structural dimensions of victimhood warrants careful development. Consider exploring how victimhood operates as a fundamental structure in psychic organization. The chapter on 'Victimhood Architecture' in 'Do You Read Me' and the section on 'Structural Analysis' in 'Triumphant Victim' provide essential frameworks for understanding these dynamics."
