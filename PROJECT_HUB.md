## AGENT CONTEXT DIRECTIVES

### CRITICAL DIRECTIVE
All agent-generated prose and reports must strictly use **"Mr. John F. Miller"** as the client's official title. Any deviation (Dr., Prof., etc.) requires immediate STOP PROTOCOL and correction.

### RATIONALE
This directive ensures brand consistency and maintains the professional academic identity established in the client profile. All future content generation must reference this standard.
